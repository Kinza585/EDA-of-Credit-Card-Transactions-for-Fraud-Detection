# **Title**

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Credit Card Transactions for Fraud Detection**

## **Problem Statement**

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers. Fraudulent activities cause substantial losses and impact customer trust. This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on credit card transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior.

## **Dataset**

- **Name:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## **Steps**

1. Load and explore the data.  
2. Analyze basic statistics and distribution.  
3. Identify fraudulent vs. legitimate transaction counts and percentages.  
4. Visualize key insights using bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

## **Technologies**

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## **EDA Questions**

1. How many rows and columns are in the dataset?  
2. What are the column names and their data types?  
3. Are there any missing or null values in the dataset?  
4. How many transactions are fraudulent, and how many are legitimate?  
5. What percentage of transactions are fraudulent?  
6. What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for numerical columns like Amount?  
7. What is the maximum transaction amount in the dataset, and is it fraudulent?  
8. Can we create a bar chart showing the count of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions?  
9. What does the histogram of transaction amounts look like?  
10. Can we use a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical features?
